[**LimbicAI**](https://github.com/ASH1998/LymbAI) is an AI that induces emotions like fear in AI, which might be a solution to the problem of AI apocalypse(which might come sooner than expected).

## Why LimbicAI

The works of Limbic System in human brain are involved in motivation, emotion, learning, and memory. A part of the limbic system, the *Amygdala* is involved in many cognitive processes. It is also the part that induces fear into humans and make them more attentive towards their surroundings.

Similarly, the goal of LimbicAI is to make an AI that will have rule over another AI and continue to monitor its progress, it will be like a supervisor with definite authority over a Generalised Artificial Intelligence.

**Disclaimer** : LimbicAI is not a Generalized AI in itself.

1. **Problem of adversarial noise mis-classification**. A common problem to any DL model is that when a little noise is added to the gradient, the model will mis-classify the images; here below images using [inception model](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/image_recognition).
